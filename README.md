# clothes-before-code
A simple choose-your-own-adventure Unity2D game in C# where you have to do the laundry before learning to code - mind those socks!

This is my own version of the game Text-101, the first game we are learning in 'Learn to Code by Making Games - The Complete Unity Developer' course on Udemy. https://www.udemy.com/unitycourse/learn/v4/overview
